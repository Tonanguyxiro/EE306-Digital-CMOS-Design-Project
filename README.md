# EE306 Digital CMOS Design Project

**This is the final project for EE306 Digital CMOS Design by *School of Microelectronic* (SME), *Southern University of Science and Technology* (SUSTech).**

Project Team members including YUAN Tong and FAN Qinyuan from class 2018.

## Introduction

Here is a brief introduction of the project, for more details please refer to the **[Project Report](Report/IEEE_report/4x4_multiplier_design.pdf)**, we will first introduce the design of basic gates, adders and the structure of the 4x4 multiplier. Then, we will create a layout for our design. All the procedure are following the Top-to-Down design and Down-to-Top develop.

## Project Structure

### Design

We put [design files](Design/multiplier), the [figure of the schematic and layout](Design/Design_figures) and [simulation results](Design/simulation) in [this forder](Design).

- [Design_figures](Design/Design_figures)
- [multiplier](Design/multiplier)
- [simulation](Design/simulation)
  - [ADE_output](Design/simulation/ADE_output)
  - [test_files](Design/simulation/test_files)
  - [trans_result](Design/simulation/trans_result)

## Performance

## Layout Technic

Here we will introduce some layout skills that TAs will not tell you during the course, but they greatly helped me to improve the performance of the multiplier
